Random projects i made for fun

This repository is a collection of random projects I built for fun, experimentation, and learning. Think of it as a playground for ideas that didn’t make it into production—but were too fun not to create.

## Projects
- Each folder contains a separate project. They vary in language, framework, and complexity. Check the folder names and their individual READMEs (if available) for instructions on how to run them.

## Goals
- Explore new technologies and tools
- Practice coding and problem-solving
- Have fun building things without deadlines
